# Film

This repository contains a simple static website that loads the last 50 watched films from Letterboxd for the user `abusayed`.

## How it works
The site fetches and displays the latest 50 films watched by the specified Letterboxd user using an embed from [lb.sayed.app](https://lb.sayed.app).

## Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML file. Loads and displays the Letterboxd embed.
- `CNAME`: Custom domain configuration for GitHub Pages.
